# Project Wanderdog

This application draws from public information to obtain free trails, camp grounds, and parks for your 4-legged pooch!

## Getting Started

* [Click here for Original Wanderdog](https://kimiinglet.github.io/meanLeanFreakGoat/)
* [Click here for Wanderdog V2](https://cml2377.github.io/Wanderdog/)

These instructions will help you locate the perfect spot to spend time with your pups.

As dog owners, we wanted to find areas in the US where we can camp/hike with our dogs off-leash, so that we can spend quality time with our dogs and allow them to explore nature.

## How to use Wanderdog

Using geolocation, Wanderdog maps out locations near you where you can take your dog off-leash.

We used Recreation's API to return campsites where dogs are allowed. We also searched for state parks and forests where you can visit with your dog off-leash. 
Please keep in mind:
